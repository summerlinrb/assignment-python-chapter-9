"""
Notes
source_to_unzip is the name of the file to unzip 
if the file to unzip is not in the current directory 
the source_to_unzip could also be in the directory name and the file name
combined, e.g., "ecommerce/file.zip"
The target_directory is the director where you want the contents to 
be unzipped to. The target_directory can be any directory.
In this example "extract" will be the name of the 
directory to where the files will be unzipped.
"""
# How to extract multiple zip files
# create a list object, a list of files to unzip
list_of_files = ["files.zip", "icons.zip"]
# extract each zip file one at a time in a for loop
target_directory = "extract"
for file in list_of_files:
    with ZipFile(file) as zip:
        zip.extractall(target_directory)
print("done extracting from multiple files")
